Hi there, I'm Christopher. Welcome to my GitHub account. If you want to know more about me you can check out the [About](https://thatamazingprogrammer.com/about/) section of my website.

Since I have so many repositories I wanted to make a guided tour because that sounds so much better than calling it a directory.
